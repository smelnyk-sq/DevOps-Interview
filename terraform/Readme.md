# Terraform EC2 Deployment Project

This project contains Terraform configuration files for deploying an EC2 instance on AWS. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to set up backend state storage in an S3 bucket and modify the configuration to deploy multiple EC2 instances.

## Objectives

1. **Configure Backend State Storage on S3:**
   - Set up Terraform to store its state files in an S3 bucket, allowing for safe storage and collaboration.

2. **Deploy Multiple EC2 Instances:**
   - Modify the Terraform configuration to launch two EC2 instances instead of one.
